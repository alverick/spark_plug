## Description

Spark Plug Cakephp plugin is a "pulled-out" script from the flashub.com project. It uses the Authsome component and uses a very simple access control routine. 

Sample Ideas:

- Forum, Q&A site, Dating site, Review site, Blog/Microblog Twitter clone.

## Features

- Easy to install. This is totally subjective but is one of the main features.

- Multi User Registration/Login. This enables your project to have multi-user access. For example you want to write a forum site. This plug-in provides below:

 - Registration form - Users have to fill-up the registration form and it will send an activation email. After activation the user's password is hashed for security.

 - Login Form - The page to login your username and password.

 - Remember me cookie** - Thanks to the authsome component, you can just check the remember me checkbox and you will log-in to your site immediately.

 - Change password - Users can log-in to your site change your current password.

 - Forgot password - When your user forgot his password he can use this form to reset it.

- User dashboard section. When a user logs in it redirects you to the dashboard.

- Simple ACL. Your site's user section is protected. Visitors must login to get access to the dashboard.

## Scope/Limitation
